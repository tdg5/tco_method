  # Allows for executing a block of code with tail call optimization enabled.
  #
  # All code that is evaluated in the block will be evaluated with tail call
  # optimization enabled, however here be dragons, so be warned of a few things:
  #
  # 1. Though it may not be obvious, any call to `require`, `load`, or similar
  # methods from within the block will be evaluated by another part of the VM
  # and will not be tail call optimized. This applies for `tco_eval` as well.
  #
  # 2. The block will be evaluated with a different binding than the binding it
  # was defined in. That means that references to variables or other binding
  # context will result in method errors. For example:
  #
  #     some_variable = "Hello, World!"
  #     womp_womp = TCOMethod.with_tco { some_variable }
  #     # => NameError: Undefined local variable or method 'some_variable'
  #
  # 3. Though this approach is some what nicer than working with strings of
  # code, it comes with the tradeoff that it relies on the the `method_source`
  # gem to do the work of finding the source of the block. There are situations
  # where `method_source` can't accurately determine the source location of a
  # block. That said, if you don't format your code like a maniac, you should be
  # fine.
  #
  # @param [Proc] block The proc to evaluate with tail call optimization
  #   enabled.
  # @return [Object] Returns whatever the result of evaluating the given block.
